# alarmManagement

The purpose of this project is to retrieve recurrently created CSV files, add them to a database and create a user interface. 

Every 24 hours each alarm creates a CSV file with the information of the day (start and end time, description, recipient etc.). More than ten alarms are listed and we want to be able to add more. 

The user must be able to add alarms and change the location where the CSV files for each alarm are saved. All of this with a simple graphical interface for a non-expert.
